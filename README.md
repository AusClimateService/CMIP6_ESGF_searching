# CMIP6/ESGF searching tools for ACS

### Subdaily_data_for_RCMs

This tool is based on the python script 'cmip6-variable-search.py' 
developed by Scott Wales "https://gist.github.com/ScottWales/f24a56ca7ad64089e1d5eaf111f9b6df"

Using a pre-defined list of CMIP6 variable requirements, it will identify models and ensemble members 
that match these requirements as per the CMIP6/ESGF database.

request downloads into oi10 (NCI's CMIP6 ESGF replication project).
